## Designing Mascot / 正在设计的吉祥物

For Traintime PDA：
- ["PDA Girl"](https://github.com/BenderBlog/traintime_pda/blob/main/assets/art/pda_girl_default.png): From Traintime PDA, a girl Superbart encountered when he attend a "MSC meeting", he regrets not querying hers QQ. Since little infomation, Superbart cannot design further information, apart from her cloth. Superbart was annoyed by BenderBlog about the PDA's development, so he designed her 'unhappy face'. *Now abandoned for triple sunflower / himawari theme, the code name of v1.5.0. But I will never forget her and her partner...*
- ["First Himawari"](https://github.com/BenderBlog/traintime_pda/blob/main/assets/art/pda_girl_default.png): A teacher teaching physics. I was trying to highlight the "learning" stuff, a teacher teaching physics is a good point. Originally I want to paint [Furutani Himawari](https://yuruyuri.fandom.com/wiki/Himawari_Furutani), but failed. So I managed to paint her in the Chinese College student in the 1920s. [Song of Youth](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9D%92%E6%98%A5%E4%B9%8B%E6%AD%8C_(%E5%B0%8F%E8%AF%B4)) is a good novel and a good movie.
- ["Second Himawari"](https://github.com/BenderBlog/traintime_pda/blob/main/assets/art/pda_girl_reading.png): A young school teacher, based on [Nohara Himawari](https://crayonshinchan.fandom.com/wiki/Himawari_Nohara). The paper she holds is still based on the original PDA Girl reading picture, with Unidad Popular changed to Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia.
- ["Third Himawari"](https://github.com/BenderBlog/traintime_pda/blob/main/assets/art/pda_girl_singing.png): A failure attempt to paint [Kazami Yuka](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Yuuka_Kazami).

For CMCalc
- ["Dr. Rebecca Sklodowzka"](https://github.com/BenderBlog/cmcalc/blob/main/mascot/Calendar_Conversion.jpg): From CMCalc, specially designed for "Calendar Transfer" function. A jewish, she is a geographical teacher from Poland. She got the god's inspiration when she was attending University of Gdańsk, about the ability to *telling time by the stars and determining location by the Moon*.
